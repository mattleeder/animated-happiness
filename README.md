CSGO Hub Dashboard in Dash

Simple Faceit hub dashboard built in dash. Currently takes a tab delimited .txt file as input containing the hub_id, api_key and default_player. e.g.

hub_id  x  
api_key y  
default_player z  



To Do:  
  
Clean up objects (prune methods, add comparisons between players)  
Make elo data easy to attach to matches, elo gained/lost per player, player performance target and actuals  
Add ability to create balanced teams an cycle through, or partial assemble teams and have the rest filled out
